# CrossJoin-AESO Discord Bot

### Prelude:
This is my first experience using both the discord.py library to make a basic discord app as well as my first time utilizing the AESO API. In essence what it currently does is let you say !CrossJoin then type a command and sometimes extension to run a command that the bot uses to call the API and process it into usable information.

### Future Additions:
Add in graph ad chart visualizations
Switch to using the discord ```/``` command notation
Cleanup and refinement of some parts of the system
Integrate 511 Alberta and AMA Road Reports into the bot if possible through their APIs

### Contributing Guidelines:
Step 1: Check to see if something you would like to add already has a feature branch. If it does then go and get involved in the conversation there to see if your ideas can be implemented.
Step 2: If there is an addition you would like to make to the bot, feel free to start making a feature branch and explain the purpose of that feature in the branch.
