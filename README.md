# CrossJoin-AESO Discord Bot

### Prelude:
This is my first experience using both the discord.py library to make a basic discord app as well as my first time utilizing the AESO API. In essence what it currently does is let you say !CrossJoin then type a command and sometimes extension to run a command that the bot uses to call the API and process it into usable information.

### Future Additions:
- Add in graph ad chart visualizations </br>
- Switch to using the discord ```/``` command notation </br>
- Cleanup and refinement of some parts of the system </br>
- Integrate 511 Alberta and AMA Road Reports into the bot if possible through their APIs
