# CrossJoin-AESO Discord Bot

# PR testing. 

### Prelude:
This is my first experience using both the discord.py library to make a basic discord app as well as my first time utilizing the AESO API. In essence what it currently does is let you say !CrossJoin then type a command and sometimes extension to run a command that the bot uses to call the API and process it into usable information.

### How to use:
- Add the bot to your server.
- Command prefix for the bot is `!CrossJoin`.
- To view help, type `!CrossJoin help`.

### Future Additions:
- [ ] Add in graph and chart visualizations.
- [ ] Switch to using the discord `/` command notation.
- [ ] Cleanup and refinement of some parts of the system.
- [ ] Integrate road reports into the bot if possible through their APIs.
  - [ ] 511 Alberta.
    - [x] 511 Cameras.
    - [ ] 511 Road conditions. 
  - [ ] AMA Road Reports.

### Contributing Guidelines:
Step 1: Check to see if something you would like to add already has a feature branch. If it does then go and get involved in the conversation there to see if your ideas can be implemented.</br>
Step 2: If there is an addition you would like to make to the bot, feel free to start making a feature branch and explain the purpose of that feature in the branch.
